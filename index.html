                When you think about how to get around in a city, what usually comes to mind is a map of streets and 
                sidewalks forming islands -- city blocks -- of buildings, in a
                sea of car and pedestrian traffic, streets, and lanes.

                But some of the most iconic and charming cities
                around the world are known for their alleyways.

                And while they might not be "tree-shrouded walks", have garage or trash access,
                 or even be particularly narorw, the simple reason for their
                inclusion is that sometimes places just have the <i>feel</i> of an alley.
                <br><br>

                Oftentimes this "feeling" arises from the lack of focus on motor vehicle
                through-traffic -- none of the places that will be considered alleys 
                have unrestricted car traffic -- which makes them quieter, 
                more peaceful, and feel more human.

                    average noise levels for a minute or two, and compare to sidewalks?
                    Plot it all. Then, I can likely make the point that they're
                     also islands of quiet in the city.

                    The various appearances, sizes, and "feels" of New Haven's
                    many alleys leads to some being used more than others. 
                    
                    We can visualize <span>how frequently</span> each alley

                    Alleys add a lot of character to a city.
                    And there <i>are</i> <span>new alleys being built</span>
                     in New Haven -- but they're not <i>public</i>.

                    Many of the <span>new housing developments</span> 
                    in downtown New Haven have used what <i>could</i> be public 
                    alley space as private courtyard space.

                    These alley spaces could often be used as 
                    walking shortcuts, or be lovely paths to stroll
                    or congregate;
                    <br><br>

                    But right now, 
                    <span> almost all of these new alleys</span>
                    are private spaces with exclusive entry for their residents; 
                    and these developments are all expensive luxury apartments.

                While the privatization of this space is the culmination
                of many aspects of modern urban development, <br><br>

                it's more important that we notice and recognize 
                the value of our alleys.

                Compared to the extensive street network, 
                New Haven's little alleys are short, tight, and
                infrequent.
                
                <br><br>
                But they're cute, fun, and have a lot of potential. 
                They're spaces that can shorten commutes, 
                be enjoyable to walk through, and serve as 
                a spot to congregate and chill. And given the
                frequency of their use,
                we know there <i>is</i> demand for them, 
                and people enjoy the spaces.

                <p style="padding-bottom:20rem;">
                    And as is the case with the conversion of Wall Street
                    to the Alexander Walk,
                    <br><br>
    
                    Or the redevelopment and alley-ification of Court St
                    by the Orange Street Promenade,
                    <br><br>
                </p>

        <div class="step-paragraph">
            <p>
                We <i>can</i> make more quaint alleys 
                that are lovely to walk through, with the right
                advocation and approach to urban development.
            </p>

        <div class="step-paragraph">
            <p>
                Our alleys should be as cherished, as
                 known, and as prioritized as
                spaces as our streets and parks.

                One day, maybe New Haven can be full of alleys as 
                versatile and as beautiful as Court St.
